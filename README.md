# binarycalc
Final challenge for HackerRank Week 2 Javascript

This project was a straightforward conversion from base 10 to base 2 number logic, applying standard operators (+ - * /) to a simple GUI that simulates a calculator. Enjoy!

Edit: Discovered a bug when testing the calculator through jsbin on firefox.  There is a redundancy occurring when buttons are pressed in the output window.
